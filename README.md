# Robust Behavioral Cloning for Autonomous Vehicles

In this work, we present a lightweight pipeline for robust behavioral cloning of a human driver using end-to-end imitation learning. The proposed pipeline was employed to train and deploy three distinct driving behavior models onto a simulated vehicle.

## Simulation System
The simulation system employed for validating the proposed pipeline was a rework of an [open source simulator](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim) developed by Udacity. The simulator can be found [here](https://github.com/Tinker-Twins/Behavioral-Cloning-Simulator).
