# Robust Behavioral Cloning for Autonomous Vehicles

In this work, we present a lightweight pipeline for robust behavioral cloning of a human driver using end-to-end imitation learning. The proposed pipeline was employed to train and deploy three distinct driving behavior models onto a simulated vehicle.
